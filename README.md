# Detect-Enemy-Mines-Project

In this project we will be working with a sonar data set, indicating whether a perticular obstacle in the way of our Submarine is a Rock or a Mine. We will try to create a model that will predict whether the obstacle is a Rock or a Mine based off the readings of our sonar.
